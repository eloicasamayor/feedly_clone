          'Last week OnePlus CEO Pete Lau said in a forum post that the company will “further integrate” with Oppo, but didn’t elaborate on how that’d work in practise. Now, leaker Evan Blass has obtained a document that serves as a talking points memo for use by OnePlus PR, and it explains the integration in plainer terms. “With the integration, OnePlus becomes a brand within Oppo, however will continue to function as an independent entity,” reads the most pertinent answer. The memo also says that Lau’s role as chief product officer at Oppo will make him responsible for the product strategies of both Oppo and OnePlus.This isn’t particularly surprising. Here’s what I wrote last week following Lau’s post',

          'TheThe Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G, as you may have pieced together, is a phone with a built-in stylus and 5G. It’s a slightly upgraded version of the 4G-only, 2021-edition Moto G Stylus (I’m sorry, that’s really how these phones are named). The Stylus 5G includes a few more hardware upgrades in addition to 5G connectivity, including a bigger battery, more storage and RAM (256GB and 6GB on the version I tested, respectively), and a newer Snapdragon 480 processor. There’s a new stylus-friendly GIF creator mode, which is fun. Fun is good! But it more or less feels like the same phone: the rear camera array is identical with the exception of a different macro sensor, its 6.8-inch screen is the same, and overall dimensions are similar.',

          'Some purists might sneer at the idea of playing retro games in anything other than their original 4:3 aspect ratio. But for anyone else, a new widescreen hack for Super Mario World means you can now enjoy the 1990 game on modern displays, without having to put up with black bars or a weirdly stretched image. Super Mario World Widescreen is the work of ROM hacker Vitor Vilela, and works by modifying the original game’s ROM when played through the bsnes_hd emulator. It means the game’s original 256x224 internal screen size can be adjusted to 352×224 to give it the correct aspect ratio for a 16:9 display. As well as 16:9, the patch also supports 16:10 resolutions, and ultrawide 21:9 support is planned for the future.',

          'Microsoft has updated its PC Health Check App to show more information about why your computer won’t be able to run Windows 11, to help deal with some of the confusion that’s sprung up around compatibility. If you’ve already downloaded the app, it should auto-update when you go to run it again, and if you haven’t downloaded it yet you can get it here. There’s been a bit of confusion about what Windows 11 will and won’t run on, and the previous version of the tool didn’t necessarily help clear any of it up, mainly showing users a pass/fail message with no details. Now, it should at least give some clue as to why your computer isn’t compatible, be it an issue with storage, secure boot compatibility, or your processor. As some have pointed out, the messages the tool gives out are still light on details in some cases: “the processor isn’t supported” isn’t really an actionable item, as it doesn’t tell you why your CPU can’t run Windows 11. If you’d rather upgrade a component or two in your system instead of just going out and buying a new PC, you’re going to have to do some more research. You may want to wait on that, though: Microsoft still seems to be working through its messaging of what is and isn’t supported, especially when it comes to CPUs. So stay tuned for a final answer before you try to brave the PC part market during a chip shortage.',

          'The US is not the only country sending video from Mars. SpaceNews reports that China has released both video and audio from the Zhurong rover s early forays on the Red Planet. The clips cover the landing as well as the deployment and initial movement. There-s also a panorama revealing just how far Zhurong has traveled (about 774 feet in total) from its landing platform. This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here, then reload the page to see it. As with sounds from NASAs Perseverance, you should not expect an extraterrestrial symphony. You are mainly listening to the mechanisms and the sound of wheels on the exit ramp, with Mars thin atmosphere also skewing the results. Mars audio remains extremely rare, though, so the mission crew can not exactly be picky. There is little doubt the footage is as much about bragging rights as anything. Zhurong is part of China first truly independent mission to another planet, and the country no doubt wants to highlight its accomplishments in as much detail as possible. Between this and Perseverance, though, it is also clear that Mars exploration has changed in recent years. It is not enough to provide a handful of photos — an audiovisual experience is increasingly becoming par for the course.',

          'Nvidia said it “reinvented computer graphics” with the unveiling of its Nvidia Turing graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture. The architecture will be the foundation for a whole family of future graphics chips that will focus on real-time ray tracing, or highly realistic, physically accurate graphics. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said in a keynote speech at the Siggraph computer graphics event in Vancouver, Canada, that the new design is the “greatest leap since the invention of the CUDA GPU in 2006.” The architecture can process graphics at six times the speed of the previous generation. Turing features new RT Cores to accelerate ray tracing and new Tensor Cores for artificial intelligence inferencing which, together for the first time, make real-time ray tracing possible, the company said.',

          'Earlier this week, we got our first look at the design of Samsung s upcoming Galaxy Watch Active 4. Now, a new leak has revealed one of the key features of the Galaxy Watch 3 successor. According to reliable tipster Max Weinbach, the Galaxy Watch 4 will feature a BIA (Bio-Electrical Impedance Analysis) sensor to enable users to easily measure their body fat percentage in relation to the lean body mass. Since body composition is directly related to health, the Galaxy Watch 4s BIA sensor will allow you to better track your current state of health. While BIA sensors are common in smart scales, it looks like Samsung will be the first company to add one to a smartwatch. The follow-up to Samsung s best Android smartwatch was initially rumored to feature blood glucose measurement as well, but recent reports suggest Samsung has dropped the feature for some reason. It is expected to come with a circular AMOLED display featuring thinner bezels than its predecessor, an SpO2 sensor for blood oxygen monitoring, and an all-new Exynos chipset built on a 5nm process. As announced at Google I/O 2021 last month, both the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Active will be running the unified "new" Wear OS platform co-developed by Samsung and Google.',
